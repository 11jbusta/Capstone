This Folder is part of a Capstone Project where the first two datasets (1 Objects and 2 Floats) are for treating data as well as initial models, while the last two datasets (3 Predicting Financial Health and 4 Clustering top 60 Variables) are the final deployed models. The numbers are the order in which they should run because there are changes in datasets that can be used by other Jupyter Notebooks.
